# Stress and Taxes
A Dredge mod about Stress and Taxes (taxes not included, please purchase the dlc)

### Description
The purpose of this mod is to focus on the risk/reward part of Dredge. The taxes (not yet implemented) as well as night fish costing more will (hopfully) cause a greater reason to fish at night while more dangerous sanity and higher repair cost will stop that.

### Contents
 - Most monsters scale in danger based off your panic level.
 - You can take loans to repair your ship by entering single target repair and selecting something that costs more money than you have saved.
 - Nightfishes give more money, everything sells for less and everything costs more.
 - Taxes (Not yet included)
