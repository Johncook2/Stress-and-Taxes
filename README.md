# Stress and Taxes
A barely functioning Dredge mod about Stress and Taxes (still in the prototype phase)

### Description
The purpose of this mod is to focus on the risk/reward part of Dredge. The taxes (not yet implemented) as well as night fish costing more will (hopfully) cause a greater reason to fish at night while more dangerous sanity and higher repair cost will stop that.

### Features
 - Most monsters scale in danger based off your panic level.
 - Quite possibly the worst way to store the players debt inbetween sessions, but it is changeable! 
 - You can take loans to repair your ship by entering single target repair and selecting something that costs more money than you have saved.
 - Nightfishes give more money, everything sells for less and everything costs more.
 - Taxes (Not yet included)

### Purpose
I started working on this mod before the Pale Reach, then sort of left it alone. I'm hoping if I publish it then I'll work on this more, and potentially get help easier as my code will be visible.
