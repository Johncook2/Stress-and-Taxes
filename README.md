# Stress and Taxes
A slightly functioning Dredge mod about Stress and Taxes

### Description
The purpose of this mod is to focus on the risk/reward part of Dredge. The taxes as well as night fish costing more will (hopefully) cause a greater reason to fish at night while more dangerous sanity and higher repair cost will stop that.

### Features
 - Most monsters scale in danger based off your panic level.
 - Quite possibly the worst way to store the players debt inbetween sessions, but it works! 
 - You can take loans to repair your ship by entering single target repair and selecting something that costs more money than you have saved.
 - Nightfishes give more money, everything sells for less and everything costs more.
 - Taxes (Now included)
 - Being stressed out for long periods of time is now a bad idea
